--Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. 
--Order your output by the last three characters of each name. 
--If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.
SELECT Name
FROM STUDENTS
WHERE Marks > 75  
ORDER BY RIGHT(Name,3), ID ASC


--Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns: Name, Grade and Mark. 
--Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. 
--The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. 
--If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. 
--Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. 
--If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.
